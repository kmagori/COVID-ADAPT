# COVID-ADAPT

COVID-ADAPT is an individual-based stochastic discrete-space simulation model of airborne disease transmission and infection control practices. It was inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-21, but can be used to model any disease transmitted by airborne droplets between hosts with a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered transmission cycle. 

Disease transmission occurs in the model by infectious individuals exhaling viral particles which contaminate a location. Susceptible individuals who enter the location can become exposed with a specific probability that is a function of the number of viral particles in the cell they reside in. Exposed individuals become infectious with a probability that is a logistic function of the time since they became exposed. Infectious individuals recover with a probability that is a logistic function of the time since they became infectious. Viral particles accumulate in each cell as a linear function of the time an infectious individual spent in each cell, and decay exponentially with the concentration of viral particles in each cell. The model assumes discrete space, meaning that the facility being modeled is broken up into a grid of rectangular cells, with a size of either 6 feet by 6 feet, or 2 feet by 2 feet, or any other size. Individuals can move according to the von Neumann neighborhood, either west, east, north or south, leaving the possibility of upwards or downwards movement for later implementation of the model with multiple stories and/or stairs. If an individual moves, the probability that the individual will move to one of the four cardinal directions is determined by four probabilities assigned to each cell. Cells on the edges are defined as having a probability of zero for individuals attempting to go off the map, while cells in the corners are defined by having a probability of zero for going to two of the four cardinal directions off the map. For now, individuals move according to Brownian motion, such that they have equal probability of moving to any of the permitted directions. For now, two individuals are not allowed to be present in the same cell, and if they would end up in the same cell by Brownian motion, the movement will be aborted. However, this can be relaxed in subsequent versions. 

The model is an event-based stochastic model, with the following four events occuring, based on their propensity functions: (1) movement; (2) susceptible individuals becoming exposed; (3) exposed individuals becoming infectious; (4) infectious individuals recovering. Viral particle levels are recalculated at each event in each cell, in a deterministic fashion.

Input to the model is currently at the code level. Output is generated as a form of a CSV file, with each row printed following each event. Rows contain the time of the event; the location of the two individuals in the grid at that time; the infection status of the two individuals; the viral particle levels in each of the cells, enumerated from the top left corner, starting with location 0, going to the right and down. Visualization of the map, and the dynamics of the location and infection status of the two individuals and the viral levels in each cell is done in R, and saved into an animated GIF.
